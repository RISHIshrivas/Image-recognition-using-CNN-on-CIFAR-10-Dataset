# Image Recognition using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes the following components:

- Loading and exploring the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Data preprocessing, including scaling and one-hot encoding of the target variable.
- Building and training a CNN model for image recognition.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and generating a confusion matrix.
- Visualizing the training process and results through graphs and plots.
- Implementing an alternative model using the DenseNet121 architecture for comparison.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `image_recognition_cnn_cifar10.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the CNN model implementation and training.
- `model.png`: Flow chart of the CNN model architecture.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
Open and run the image_recognition_cnn_cifar10.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or any Python IDE.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Train the CNN model and evaluate its performance.
Optionally, experiment with the DenseNet121 model provided in the notebook.

## Results and Visualizations
The project includes visualizations of the training process, accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
You can find these visualizations in the notebook and the model.png file for the flow chart of the model architecture.
